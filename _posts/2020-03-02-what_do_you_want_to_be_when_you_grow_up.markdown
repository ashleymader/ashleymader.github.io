I can promise you, the answer to that question was ***never*** a software engineer. First I wanted to be a nurse, then an athletic director, physical therapist, phychologist, sales manager, customer success manager.... the list goes on. What I'm getting at here is I've not really had a path for anything. In fact, it's always blown my mind that people actually know what they want to do. They have a passion for something and find a career path that fits. I've never had that. I just jump from one thing to the next sort of floating through life. Recently I was working in a sales position doing extremely well, but I hated it. I didn't find any enjoyment or sense of accomplishment in it. I was completely unfulfilled. So, I quit. With no plan for what to do next, but just knowing I wanted more for myself. I didn't want a *job* anymore, I wanted a ***career***. 

In the my search for a career, I came across a position of a Customer Success Manager. I found it an interesting mix of sales and customer service, but the only downside was I needed to have experience in coding, or at least a basic understanding. With that, I decided to teach myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. MOOCS here I come! I signed up for Coursera and went to work. About one week in, do you know what I realized? I actually ENJOY this. For the first time in my adult life, I found something that I actually enjoy doing that has a viable career path for me. Even better, it allows me to work remotely. My husband is active duty military, so remote work is ideal when you move every year to three years. 

Once I realized I found a sense of accomplishment and enjoyment,  I started thinking that maybe I didn't just want to be a customer success manager, I actually wanted to code for a living. After hours and hours of research and taking the bootcamp prep course to make sure this was a good fit for me, I enrolled in the self-paced program. My goal has been to keep up with the full time students and so far I'm right on track. 

I have no idea what I want to specialize in after graduation, but I'm excited about the furture of having a career instead of just a job.
