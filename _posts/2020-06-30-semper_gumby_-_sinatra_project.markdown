After completing my CLI project I hit the ground running with the Sinatra section. I had big plans and a timeline to keep my graduation date on track with what I had planned. I should have known better..... being a military spouse, plans are never set in stone; *semper gumby (always flexible)* as they say and oh boy would I have to be just that. 

Coronavirus, the thing that changed it all. See, I have ADHD, so focusing on coding is either an all in, hyperfocus, lose track of time, forget to eat thing, OR, something that I can't focus on at all because of distractions; and distractions were aplenty. My husband's MBA program went to online and so did our sons. So on top of being full-time students, suddenly we were both full-time teachers as well. Spending around 6 hours with our son, Dustin, going through all his coursework for the day, correcting it, having him fix it, and then turning it in became overwhelming. Try to manage his course work with my course work became untenable. While I wanted my timeline for graduation to remain the same, I just had to accept our new normal and move forward. 

Once we had a full routine of Dustin's school, my husband's school and my own down to a science, Nick graduated with his MBA and Dustin had completed the 1st grade. WOOHOO right? Well, just to complicate things a little more we got military orders to Philadelphia. So, we've been on the road and essentially living in our RV for over a month and really aren't sure when that will end either. Fingers crossed they can finish building our house ASAP so we can move in finally.

All the while, I've been pecking away at the Sinatra section and even started my project. I got around halfway through and hit a brick wall with motivation and mental energy between all the distractions and move. I hadn't touched my project in over A MONTH! Say what? Yeah.... I didn't even code for fun. I took a much needed break. The downside? I legit forgot where I was in my project, I had to scale it back significantly because *scope creep*, and I feel like I had to relearn a lot of it. 

All of this is to say, while my project isn't all that I wanted and my timeline for graduating isn't what I hoped, I'm ok with it. Plans and projects are meant to be changed, broken, and remade. This past month has been absolutely crazy, but I wouldn't change it for anything, not even to complete my dream Sinatra project. Semper Gumby!
