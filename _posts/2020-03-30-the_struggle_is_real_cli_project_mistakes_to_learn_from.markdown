**The Warning**

I would be lying if I said the CLI project was a breeze. Being given the freedom to create, while fantastic, is overwhelming to say the least. Where do I begin? What am I interested in? Ok, I have an idea, but is the website scrapeable? No? Back to the beginning. 

This was my process. Over and over until I finally settled on scraping Amazon book charts.... and even then it didn't go smoothly. I quickly realized what I wanted to do for my app/gem and what I needed to do or was capable of doing were two (three?) very different things. I also had the bright idea of moving to my local enviroment to avoid losing my work on the in-browser IDE since I'm not religious about saving. In the long run, I'm happy I did it, however I spent about 2 days working through some VERY annoying and buggy errors from the install. Total sidenote: thanks to Mark Harvey for the help getting it working.  

All in all, my first 3 days were spent essentially accomplishing nothing. I shouldn't say nothing because I did end up with a workable idea, but it sure felt that way. 

**The Idea**

Build an app that scrapes the book charts on Amazon, gives book titles to the user and then the option for more information. At first, I was going to scrape all Most Read and Most Sold. That turned out to be a much larger task than necessary so I pared it back to Most Read, Fiction and Non. This is technically still more than necessary but at this point I was committed to doing something from my original plan. 

**The Execution**

*Wowzers*. I was all over the place for the first day or so. This was 100% my fault. Why, you ask? I didn't make my flow chart. I'm not going to lie, I got on the draw.io page and gave it a go for about 15min and decided it was too cumbersome. This was a HUGE MISTAKE. I had no plan on how I needed to get from one place to another. I only had an idea with no real plan on how to execute it. And while I still haven't made my chart (ducks and hides), I would love to go back and slap myself in the face for not doing it.  

Finally, after writing everything down, I had my plan and I knew how to execute. It was a lot of trial and error, but by the end of it, I feel like a total pro at understanding error codes and how to debug. Not to mention really putting into practice the things we've been learning along the way. It's one thing to code to a test we have to pass. It's a completely different thing to code from scratch and make it all work. 

**The Product**

In the end I have a working gem! I completed it in about 2 days (of actual coding!).  There are some things I would love to expand on or change in the future, but for now, I'm really happy with it. I've never really created anything so it's a pretty novel moment to realize you thought of something, code it, and now it's actually functional. 

**Before You Go**

Oh, one last piece of knowlege I want to pass on here is, make an accountability buddy or 4! Not just for this project, but for the program as a whole. Having someone to check in with, someone to go to when you can't quite get something to work, it's truly an invaluable resource! My buddies are the reason I was able to finish so quickly. They kept me on track even when I was ready to walk away. 


I hope someone finds this to be helpful. While this isn't the traditional blog that shows how awesome the thing you built it, I feel like it's more authentic to my experience. Happy coding!
